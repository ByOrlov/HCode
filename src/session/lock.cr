    # LockFileEx on Windows — so the OS releases the lock when the holding
    # process dies: no stale lock files to clean up after a crash. The pid
    # written into the file is diagnostics only; the kernel lock is the
    # source of truth (a recorded pid means nothing by itself, and the OS
    # may reuse pids).

    # Read-only consumers (Index scans, session pickers, the remote
    # daemon's wire tail) never lock — readers cannot corrupt the log.
    # Metadata writers (rename / archive, which touch only state.json via
    # atomic writes) stay lock-free too: a racing rename loses at most a
    # title update, never conversation history.
